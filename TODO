** BASIC USEABILITY

* The way brracketing sytnaxes are handled is wrong. Bracketing syntaxes are
treated as inherited attributes but syntax inheritance goes the other way--from
children to parent. The bracketing syntax should be passed down like the
precedence is.

* Parsing problem:
class A {
  int a[];
  syntax('!' a*);
}
We want something like
A : {...}
  | '!' TOK_INTEGER {...}
  | A '!' TOK_INTEGER {...}

* Write tests for error cases, and improve error messages.

* More comprehensive test for non-error cases.

* DONE (dgudeman) Get alternation working

* Currently there is no storage management of the parse tree. Add ownership of
pointers and freeing them when possible.

* Get namespaces working. See ParserBase::namespace_tag.

* Figure out the story for lexical rules. How can you specify things like
whitespace definition and case-insensitivity in one place to apply to all rules?
How do you then write lexical rules that ignore these specifications? See
(http://tutor.rascal-mpl.org/Rascal/Concepts/Concepts.html) for another sytem
that does this.

* Inheritance matching: name an inherited type instead of an attribute and it
expands the inherited syntax in place.

* Array matching is currently restricted to (<attribute> * <string>). Generalize
to (<re> <attribute> <re> * <re>) where <re> matches any pattern that does not
have an attribute. Also allow (<re> <alt> <re> * <re>) where <alt> is an
alternation. For example: ((extern_flag | static_flag | register_flag)*) to
parse a sequence of flags.

* DONE (dgudeman) Implement assignment patterns:
  <attr> '{' (<re> '->' <value>*|) '}'

* We need to deal with passing a string as the value of a production. We could
either pass pointers to string and deal with allocation, or we could define our
own data types to enable it.

* Make it work with only standard tools (not dependent on google3).

* Get the output compiling and executing. Produce a simple API for the user.
See ParserBase::directory.

* Seperate class defs into .h and .cc files.

* DONE (dgudeman) Get inheritance working:
class A {
  int x;
  syntax('(' $0 ')'); // parentheses syntax
}
class B extends A {
  int y;
  syntax( 'first' x ', second' y );
}
1. DONE Every class needs to know what its child classes are.
2. DONE The rule for a class A with children is an alternation of the syntax for A
   and the nonterminals for all of its children. The actual class type produced
   is usually a child type such as B rather than A.
3. DONE Generalize this alternation
   concept so that a single class can have multiple
   class syntaxes and they become alternations.
4. DONE A '$$' in a class syntax causes a recursive match of the class, but does not
   create a new object. For example, if you match the parentheses syntax for A
   then it recursively matches A, but only one A object is created.

*  Right now it is an unchecked error to have more than one regular (that is,
not '$$') syntaxes for a class. 

* DONE Precedence and associativity(dgudeman)
These are associated with rules, not symbols, so they have to be implemented by
structuring the grammar rules insead of using directives like %left. For example
class Operation extends Expression {
  class Expression args[];
}
class Addition extends Operation {
  syntax (args[1] '+' args[2], left 6);
}
class Multiplication extends Operation {
  syntax (args[1] '*' args[2], left 4);
}

** FEATURES AND PERFORMANCE

* Multiple syntaxes. Write a syntax for language A and one for language B, and
you automatically get an A->B translator and a B->A translator. For example:
class A {
  syntax sql("...") c("...");
}
Multiple syntaxes may also be needed for a single language. Suppose there is a
class C that is parsed entirely differently in two different contexts A and B,
but it still makes sense to make it a single class in the AST. Then we can do it
like this:
class C {
 ...
 syntax A_context {...}
 syntax B_context {...}
}
class A {
  ...
  C c
  syntax(... A_context:c ...)
}
class B {
  ...
  C c
  syntax(... B_context:c ...)
}

* Cut operator: (<matcher> ! <re>). If <matcher> ends in an iterator (+ or *)
then it is normally greedy, but this will cut it off before any expression that
matches <re>.

* Cooperation operator: (<matcher1> & <matcher2>). Matches only if it both
<matcher1> and <matcher2> match.

* Output for other parser generators and languages. The parser generator has to
handle left recursion so not JavaCC. I also don't know if we are going to need
other features that can't be parsed by LR or LL parsers so it would be best to
look into general parsers (GLR, GLL, Earley, etc.) like Elkhound. Note that
bison has a GLR mode if we need it.

* Generate our own GLL parser and eliminate the requirement for a separate
parser generator.

* Expand double-quotes into parse expressions. Eg:
class Addition {
  Expression args[];
  syntax("$1 + $2");  // equivalent to syntax ( args[1] '+' args[2])
}

* Implement syntax elements attached to attributes. The semantics are as follows
class A {
  int x syntax(... $0 ...); // attribute syntax for x
  syntax(... x ...);        // class syntax
}
When you see x in the class syntax or in any other attribute syntax, then it is
replaced by the attribute syntax for x. The $0 in the attribute syntax for x is
replaced by a parser for x.

* Extend array syntax so that you can parse
syntax('prefix' array 'suffix'*'separator);

* If there are two more places where an array of T is parsed with the same
prefix, suffix, and separator, then only generate one production for all of
them.

** DOCUMENTATION

* internal web site

* user manual

** SELF PARSING
We should get to a self-parsing situation as soon as possible so we don't have
to maintain the bison code. Still needed:

* precedence and associativity

* enums

* An alternation that includes array attributes. The array attribute may appear
multiple times, adding to the appropriate array.
